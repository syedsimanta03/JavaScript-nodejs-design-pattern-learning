A topic that can easily make anyone's mind wobble. Here I try to make them stick in to your mind (and maybe mine) by explaining them in the <i>simplest</i> way possible.

   This will help you to learn Nodejs faster

## :arrow_right:  Arrow function operator 

 An **arrow function** expression is a syntactically compact alternative to a regular **function** expression, although without its own bindings to the this , arguments , super , or new. ... **Arrow function** expressions are ill suited as methods, and they cannot be used as constructors. 

ex-1

```javascript
"use strict";

var numbers = [2, 6, 7, 8, 1];
var even = numbers.filter(function(x) {
  return x % 2 === 0;
});

console.log(even);
```

ex-2: direct return for one line code

```javascript
"use strict";

var numbers = [2, 6, 7, 8, 1];
var even = numbers.filter(x => x%2 === 0);

console.log(even);
```

ex-2: arrow fun with filter

```javascript
"use strict";

var numbers = [2, 6, 7, 8, 1];
var even = numbers.filter((x) => {
  if (x % 2 === 0) {
    console.log(x + ' is even!');
    return true;
  }
});

console.log(even);
```
